        <p> As we build our websites, we are most likely writing them on a single computer and using a specific monitor or browser size to test them. But, as we know, there are many possible screen sizes that exist and we canâ€™t assume that our website visitors will be using the exact same screen size as us. So, we will want to try to build our websites responsively, so that they can adapt to the variety of device demensions and scales as best as possible. </p>
